<p>Yeah, i believe this class can be refactored.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We did not include type and machineName in 
      constructor we can achieve this by doing globally above constructor.
    </li>
    <li>absoluteMax is initialized but it is not using anywhere in the class</li>
    <li>In name() function, i have modified if condition.</li>
    <li>In description() function, i have modified description concept.</li>
    <li>i have initialized machinName on top with ''</li>

  </ol>
  <p>Other than this everything is good.</p>
